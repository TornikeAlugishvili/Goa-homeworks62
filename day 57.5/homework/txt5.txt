In Python, the filter() function is a built-in function used to construct an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.
Syntax:
Python

filter(function, iterable)
Parameters:
function:
A function that tests each element in the iterable. This function should return a boolean value (True or False). If None is passed for the function, filter() will remove elements that evaluate to False in a boolean context (e.g., 0, None, empty strings, empty lists).
iterable:
An iterable object (e.g., a list, tuple, set, string) whose elements are to be filtered.
Return Value:
The filter() function returns an iterator (a filter object). To obtain a usable collection like a list or tuple, you typically need to convert this object using list(), tuple(), etc.
How it Works:
The filter() function iterates through each element in the iterable.
For each element, it applies the function provided.
If the function returns True for an element, that element is included in the resulting filter object.
If the function returns False for an element, that element is excluded.
